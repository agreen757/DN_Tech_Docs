## Data Flow Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. User accesses application through protected route
2. ProtectedRoute component checks authentication status
3. If unauthenticated, redirects to Login component
4. Login component authenticates via Firebase Auth
5. JWT token stored and AuthContext updated
6. User granted access to protected application areas

### Email Campaign Flow
1. User navigates to MailerTemplate component (Email Template tab)
2. Component fetches user list from dn-api (`/dn_users_list`)
3. User creates email content using React Quill editor
4. Campaign data submitted to dn-api (`/send-mail`) endpoint
5. Email sent via Mailgun integration
6. Campaign tracking logged for analytics

### S3 File Browser Flow
1. User navigates to MailerTemplate component (Reports Download tab)
2. S3FileBrowser component initializes with AWS credentials via Amplify-Firebase bridge
3. Component fetches S3 bucket contents using `listObjectsV2` with hierarchical navigation
4. User browses folders using breadcrumb navigation and file table
5. User selects individual files or bulk selects multiple files
6. Download initiated using signed URLs for individual files or ZIP creation for bulk downloads
7. Download progress tracked and displayed via S3DownloadManager
8. Error handling managed through S3ErrorBoundary and toast notifications

### Data Synchronization
- **Real-time Updates**: Firebase integration for live data updates
- **API Integration**: RESTful communication with AWS API Gateway
- **Local Caching**: Strategic use of local storage for performance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and toast notifications

## Integration Points

- **API Gateway**: Primary backend communication via dn-api
- **Lambda Functions**: Serverless compute for business logic
- **Cognito**: Additional authentication provider and S3 access credentials
- **S3**: File storage for email templates, assets, and financial report downloads
  - **@aws-sdk/client-s3**: Direct S3 SDK integration for file operations
  - **Signed URLs**: Time-limited secure file access
  - **Hierarchical Navigation**: Folder-based file browsing with pagination
